# üë• HR Dashboard Project

## üìä Project Overview
The **HR Dashboard Project** is designed to create a comprehensive and interactive dashboard that provides valuable insights into an organization's workforce. This dashboard will assist HR managers and other stakeholders in making data-driven decisions related to employee management, recruitment, diversity, and compensation. By visualizing key metrics, the dashboard enables users to easily spot trends, patterns, and areas requiring improvement.

## üéØ Project Objectives:
The primary goal of this project is to empower HR managers and stakeholders with an interactive dashboard that visualizes key HR metrics for better decision-making. The main objectives include:

- **Enhance Workforce Management**: 
  - Monitor total active employees to understand staffing levels and trends.
  - Analyze employee turnover rates to identify termination patterns.
  
- **Improve Recruitment Strategies**: 
  - Track hiring trends and identify common job titles for new hires.
  - Compare recruitment rates across different periods to assess efficiency.
  
- **Optimize Departmental Staffing**: 
  - Visualize active vs. terminated employees by department.
  - Identify departments with unusually high termination rates and take corrective action.
  
- **Geographical Insights**: 
  - Map employee distribution across cities and states.
  - Analyze hiring and termination trends at headquarters vs. branch locations.
  
- **Promote Diversity and Inclusion**: 
  - Examine the workforce's demographic breakdown (gender, age, education).
  - Detect disparities in hiring or termination rates across different demographic groups.
  
- **Ensure Fair Compensation**: 
  - Evaluate salary distributions by department, job title, and location.
  - Identify salary disparities among demographic groups and examine salary trends over time.
